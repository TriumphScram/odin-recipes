            <p><h1>Ice Cream Recipe</h1></p>
            <p>Ice cream is delicious and I'd eat it EVERY day if I could.
                But then I'd be chubbier and my poop would be even weirder.
                So ice cream has got to be a sometimes food. Thankfully, it 
                keeps well and is a cinch to make when you are feeling the need!
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Some ice cream from the store</li>
                <li>A bowl (probably a mug to better control yourself, you animal</li>
                <li>A proper ice cream scoop (stop bending your spoons)</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>Take the ice cream out of the freezer</li>
                <li>Scoop the desired amount into a bowl or mug</li>
                <li>Add all sorts of other stuff to it</li>
            </ol>
